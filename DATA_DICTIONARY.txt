ANOMALY DETECTION APPROACH:

1. Train LSTM autoencoder on healthy data

OR

1. Train LSTM for RUL prediction on healthy + labeled degraded data

PHYSICAL INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

BEARING FAILURE SIGNATURES:

Primary Indicator: Vibration Increase
- Healthy: 0.15-0.45 g
- Early degradation: 0.45-0.60 g
- Critical: >0.80 g
- Most pronounced during LOADED_HAUL state

Secondary Indicators:
- Increased temperature variability (thermal stress)
- Slight changes in fuel consumption (drivetrain efficiency)
- Tire pressure may show minor fluctuations

ROOT CAUSE:
Bearing degradation in drivetrain/wheel assembly leads to:
- Increased friction
- Unbalanced rotation
- Elevated vibration levels
- Potential catastrophic failure if not addressed

MAINTENANCE IMPLICATIONS:

RUL < 24 hours: Schedule immediate inspection
RUL < 8 hours: Remove truck from service
RUL = 0: Bearing replacement required

Cost Savings:
- Predictive: Schedule maintenance, minimize downtime (~$5K)
- Reactive: Emergency breakdown, extended downtime (~$50K+)
